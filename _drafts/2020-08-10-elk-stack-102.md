This is by no means a deep dive blog on ELK but it will get you started. 
In this 3 part series, I am going to start with installing ELK stack, cover basics of Kibana console & show how log aggregation & visualization works. 
Although Iâ€™ve worked with BIG 3 cloud vendors, my current experience is with AWS & so all the examples in here are in AWS on CentOS EC2 instances.\
Whether it is a single or multi account architecture, cloud architects/administrators reply on centralized logging which entails the use of a single platform for data aggregation, processing, storage & analysis. 
Two of the most common tools used in enterprise environment are Splunk & Dynatrace. ELK has made a name for itself among plethora of new tools like Datadog, New Relic, Sumo Logic etc.
