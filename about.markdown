My name is Prashant, I spent the first part of my career in technology as a sysadmin. More specifically, a Windows sysadmin, for well over a decade. 
A few years ago I developed interest in Cloud computing and have not looked back since. 
I have a long road ahead of me as I seek to understand, learn and apply all things DevOps, but I could not be more excited! 
Along this journey I’m dedicated to documenting my learnings. Whether, that is in the form of blog posts, code repositories or recordings. 
My goal is to take as many of you with me as I can. Share what I know and learn from you what I don’t know. 
In the background, I have several obsessions. CTFs, health, fitness, and self-improvement helping me unlock my full potential. 
I am a believer of automation enabled digital transformation, my go to languages are PowerShell and Python. 
To me, cloud is a model and not a location. If you disagree then let’s discuss this over a beverage of your choice.

Stay safe!
