This is by no means a deep dive blog on ELK but it will get you started. 
In this 3 part series, I am going to start with installing ELK stack, cover basics of Kibana console & show how log aggregation & visualization works. 
Although I’ve worked with BIG 3 cloud vendors, my current experience is with AWS & so all the examples in here are in AWS on CentOS EC2 instances.

Whether it is a single or multi account architecture, cloud architects/administrators reply on centralized logging which entails the use of a single platform for data aggregation, processing, storage & analysis. 
Two of the most common tools used in enterprise environment are Splunk & Dynatrace. ELK has made a name for itself among plethora of new tools like Datadog, New Relic, Sumo Logic etc.

You can read & learn more about [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)

The ELK Stack or the Elastic Stack is the one of the most popular open source log analytics platform. ELK is short for Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana, the 3 different components in the stack.

Elasticsearch is an open source, full-text search and analysis engine. 
Logstash is a log aggregator that collects data from various input sources, executes different transformations and enhancements and then ships the data to various supported output destinations. 
Kibana is a visualization layer that works on top of Elasticsearch, providing users with the ability to analyse and visualize the data. 

There is one more component known as Beats which is lightweight agents that are installed on hosts to collect different types of data for forwarding into the ELK stack.

Combined these different components can be used for monitoring, troubleshooting and securing cloud applications and the infrastructure. 
At the time of writing this blog, AWS had over 175 services & each service generates different data, for example CloudWatch logs, S3 logs, Lamda logs, ELB logs, VPC flow logs, CloudFront logs & the list goes on. 
Apart from that there will always be application logs and infrastructure logs.

A common scenario can be applications running on EC2 instances, where Filebeat is used for tracking and forwarding application logs into ELK stack. Or, Mericbeat to track host metrics. 
There’s also Packetbeat for network data, Heartbeat for uptime monitoring, Winlogbeat for Windows Event logs, Functionbeat for ServerLess data, Auditbeat for Auditd data and Journalbeat for Journald logs.\

I have already spun up three (3) EC2 instances in my account.\
Here’s an illustration of what I am going to build, it is a lab so the focus is not on security but obviously design for production will be a lot different.

### THESE STEPS HAVE TO BE DONE ON ALL THREE NODES ###

```bash{% raw %}
[opstodevops@master ~]# rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
[opstodevops@master ~]# cd /opt/
[opstodevops@master opt]# curl -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-7.6.0-x86_64.rpm

drwxr-xr-x. 6 root root      4096 Mar 17 19:13 websh
[opstodevops@master opt]# rpm --install elasticsearch-7.6.0-x86_64.rpm
Creating elasticsearch group... OK
Creating elasticsearch user... OK
### NOT starting on installation, please execute the following statements to configure elasticsearch service to start automatically using systemd
 sudo systemctl daemon-reload
 sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
### You can start elasticsearch service by executing
 sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
Created elasticsearch keystore in /etc/elasticsearch
[opstodevops@master opt]#
```{% endraw %}

Next I will be logging in to each node and editing `elasticsearch.yml` file. 

```bash    
[opstodevops@master opt]# cd /etc/elasticsearch/
[opstodevops@master elasticsearch]# ll
total 40
-rw-rw----. 1 root elasticsearch   199 Aug  3 08:08 elasticsearch.keystore
-rw-rw----. 1 root elasticsearch  2847 Feb  6 00:21 elasticsearch.yml
-rw-rw----. 1 root elasticsearch  2373 Feb  6 00:21 jvm.options
-rw-rw----. 1 root elasticsearch 17545 Feb  6 00:21 log4j2.properties
-rw-rw----. 1 root elasticsearch   473 Feb  6 00:21 role_mapping.yml
-rw-rw----. 1 root elasticsearch   197 Feb  6 00:21 roles.yml
-rw-rw----. 1 root elasticsearch     0 Feb  6 00:21 users
-rw-rw----. 1 root elasticsearch     0 Feb  6 00:21 users_roles
[opstodevops@master elasticsearch]# vi elasticsearch.yml
```

The file has a lot of commented out lines & I will be adding couple of lines at the end of the file. 
If I grep `elasticsearch.yml` on `master` for `uncommented` lines, it looks like this.
#### DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE IP ADDRESS TO PRIVATE IP ADDRESS OF YOUR INSTANCE ####

```bash
[opstodevops@master elasticsearch]# grep ^[^#] elasticsearch.yml
cluster.name: opstodevops
node.name: master
path.data: /var/lib/elasticsearch
path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch
network.host: [_local_, _site_]
discovery.seed_hosts: ["172.31.15.195"]
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["master"]
node.master: true
node.data: false
node.ingest: true
node.ml: false
```

On `data-1` node `elasticsearch.yml` looks like this.
#### DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE IP ADDRESS TO PRIVATE IP ADDRESS OF YOUR INSTANCE ####
```bash
[root@data-1 elasticsearch]# grep ^[^#] elasticsearch.yml
cluster.name: opstodevops
node.name: data-1
node.attr.temp: hot
path.data: /var/lib/elasticsearch
path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch
network.host: [_local_, _site_]
discovery.seed_hosts: ["172.31.15.195"]
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["master"]
node.master: false
node.data: true
node.ingest: false
node.ml: false
```

On `data-2` node `elasticsearch.yml` looks like this.
#### DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE IP ADDRESS TO PRIVATE IP ADDRESS OF YOUR INSTANCE ####
```bash
[root@data-2 elasticsearch]# grep ^[^#] elasticsearch.yml
cluster.name: opstodevops
node.name: data-2
node.attr.temp: warm
path.data: /var/lib/elasticsearch
path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch
network.host: [_local_, _site_]
discovery.seed_hosts: ["172.31.15.195"]
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["master"]
node.master: false
node.data: true
node.ingest: false
node.ml: false
```

### THIS STEP IS ON MASTER NODE ONLY ###
The `master` node is mainly responsible for orchestration & data ingestion.
This is memory adjustment as `master` node doesnt need that much memory & I want to leave memory for Kibana and host.\
Here I am allocating 768MB to the heap.

```bash
[opstodevops@master elasticsearch]# vi jvm.options
[opstodevops@master elasticsearch]# grep '^-Xm'  jvm.options
-Xms768m
-Xmx768m
```

Now on all three (3) nodes, I am going to `enable` & `start` the `elasticsearch` service.

```bash
[opstodevops@master elasticsearch]# systemctl daemon-reload
[opstodevops@master elasticsearch]# systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/elasticsearch.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service.
[opstodevops@master elasticsearch]# systemctl start elasticsearch.service
```

Going through `logs` on `master` node, I can see that `data-1` & `data-2` were discovered & successfully joined the cluster.

```bash{% raw %}
[opstodevops@master elasticsearch]# less /var/log/elasticsearch/opstodevops.log

Here I am checking my cluster, I can see that system resources are not spiking & the cluster looks healthy.

In next part, I will discuss how to apply basic security to our Elasticsearch Cluster, install and& configure Kibana, configure users to log in to Kibana console & few examples of API calls.\
Hope you enjoyed reading this.

Stay tuned!
