In my earlier post [Ansible 102]({% post_url 2020-05-06-ansible-102 %}) I worked on testing Docker container by deploying and destroying an EC2 instance in AWS.\
In this post I will begin deploying resources in AWS which will bring together my 3 tier architecture. At the time of writing, the database workload is still work in progress.\
The code so far can create a VPC, 2 Availability Zones, 2 subnets, 2 instances, Elastic Application Load Balancer & relevant security groups. I have added a task to create an EC2 keypair &
download it in the Docker container which enables me to SSH into instances. Again, it is a work in progress template.

[Ansible Code](https://github.com/opstodevops/ansible-3-tier/blob/master/aws_deploy_ansible_3tier.yml)

Spinning up a brand new container and running the Ansible playbook by downlading the above code.

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it --name ansiblecontrol --env "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKAWSACCESSKEY6L" --env "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=NkTAwSsEcReTaCcEsSkEyznI" centos:ansible
[root@a83f9e004709 /]# 
[root@a83f9e004709 /]# aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "Account": "912345678908", 
    "UserId": "AKAWSACCESSKEY6L", 
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::912345678908:user/opstodevops"
}
[root@a83f9e004709 /]# ansible-playbook aws_deploy_ansible_3tier.yml --syntax-check 
[root@a83f9e004709 /]# ansible-playbook aws_deploy_ansible_3tier.yml

```

This is the state where I am trying to be by purely using Ansible. Again, I am working on the database part and will enhance the architecture in future.

I can't stress enough on is reading the [Ansible Docs](https://docs.ansible.com/). It is not only a good practice but making it a habit will ensure success in the world of Ansible. 
Don't have time to open the browser, well try these 2 commands in container `ansible-doc -l` and `ansible-doc ec2`

Ciao!
