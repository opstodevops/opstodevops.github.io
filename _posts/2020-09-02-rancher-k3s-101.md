I am sure that readers of this blog are familiar with or have heard of Kubernetes (K8s). Some of us are proficient in K8s administration while some of us have basic understanding of it.

This post is for readers who are familiar with K8s but stayed away from diving deep because of the complexity that comes with it. So if you'd like to start with something easy & simple then read on.

K8s is a beast which can get as dense as the devil desires. Thankfully folks at Rancher understood that & came up with a simple & lightweight version of Kubernetes (K8s) distribution, called K3s. 


<!--more-->

K3s is a solution designed to be run when full K8s is either not possible or not necessary. You can read more about [K3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/)

Make sure to read the reasoning behind the name though there is no official pronunciation so say it as you like.
In short, K3s is simple, easy to install, requires half the memory & everything bundled up in a single binary of less than 100MB ideal for;\
Resource constrained Edge devices\
IoT\
Development environment\
ARM devices

The architecture below is fairly simple, which is the whole concept behind K3s, simplicity. I am going to setup a `master` and a `worker` node & deploy `Nginx`. 
You can read about the [installation requirements](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/installation-requirements/)

Simple, lightweight, single binary with a sqllite storage backend. K3s is secure by default as certificate distribution is fairly easy because is a single entity.

```{% endraw %}

#### TO CREATE A CLUSTER WE NEED TWO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ####
```
K3S_URL --> URL of K3s server
K3S_TOKEN--> a token to authenticate with the K3s server & location for token is `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token`
```

#### OBTAINING THE TOKEN FROM MASTER NODE ####
```bash{% raw %}
OpsToDevOps@master $ sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
K10614a88a129efebc8a5488d52725cfe1290c09d413e20093b06a65c7e38a53949::server:1fdb61861d640d22c1fb98dc71371f18
```{% endraw %}

The `K3S_URL` is internal IP address of the `master` node listening on port 6443.

#### CREATING WORKER NODE WITH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ####
```bash{% raw %}
OpsTodevOps@worker $ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://172.31.11.10:6443 K3S_TOKEN=K10614a88a129efebc8a5488d52725cfe1290c09d413e20093b06a65c7e38a53949::server:1fdb61861d640d22c1fb98dc71371f18 sh -

```{% endraw %}

I am going to check the cluster & make sure that both the nodes are showing up in READY state.\
Indeed they are.

```bash{% raw %}
OpsToDevOps@master $ sudo kubectl get nodes
NAME               STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ip-172-31-11-10    Ready    master   99m   v1.18.8+k3s1
ip-172-31-10-191   Ready    <none>   15s   v1.18.8+k3s1
```{% endraw %}

So far, I have been using `SUDO` access to run `kubectl` commands as my standard user doesn't have access. I am going to fix that.

```bash{% raw %}
OpsToDevOps@master $ sudo groupadd k3s
OpsToDevOps@master $ sudo usermod -aG k3s $(whoami)
OpsToDevOps@master $ sudo chown root:k3s /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml                                                                                                                                 
OpsToDevOps@master $ sudo chmod 740 /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml 
OpsToDevOps@master $ logout

OpsToDevOps@master $ kubectl get nodes                                                                                                                                                        
NAME               STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
ip-172-31-10-191   Ready    <none>   4m23s   v1.18.8+k3s1
ip-172-31-11-10    Ready    master   104m    v1.18.8+k3s1
```{% endraw %}

This is the part where I will deploy a sample `NGINX` container & execute a `curl` command to get default page back. 

```yaml{% raw %}
OpsToDevOps@master cat << EOF | kubectl create -f -
> apiVersion: v1
> kind: Pod
> metadata:
>   name: nginx
> spec:
>   containers:
>   - name: nginx
>     image: nginx
> EOF
pod/nginx created
```{% endraw %}

I will check for logs, nodes and pods to make sure I am on track. Everything that we have built so far coming together.

```bash{% raw %}
OpsToDevOps@master kubectl get pods -w

Hopefully this blog helped you understand a bit about K3s. If you want to get your hands dirty with something less daunting than K8s, I suggest K3s.

Until next time, keep on learning & stay safe.
