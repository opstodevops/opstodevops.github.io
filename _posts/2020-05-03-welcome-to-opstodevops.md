Hey! Everyone, welcome to my blog.

```python
def welcome():
  print("Hey! Everyone")
welcome()
```


```powershell
Write-Output "Hey! Everyone"
```

OK, something that I have to get out of the way is "this is not going to be a fancy blog".

It will mostly contain my continuous journey from a sysadmin to DevOps enegineer, regular tech rants and often tech work that I am doing which I find interesting to share.

Oh and reminders for myself so I can keep a check on my progress.
