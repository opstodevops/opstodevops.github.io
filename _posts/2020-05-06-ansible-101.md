I should have named this post Ansible with Docker or Ansible in Docker or something similar but the idea here is to keep the distinction between the 2 tools while making them work togther.
There is no need for me to explain what Docker is, plethora of articles are available on the internet. Matter of fact, here is [Docker workshop](https://dockr.ly/intro-workshop) link.

Create an account on Docker hub, login to the workshop portal and start Dockering. What I have been trying for past couple of days was to create a Docker image which can work as Ansible control node.
Why? So that I can have a  clean environment whenever I want with a small footprint on my laptop. Have a Docker image with Ansible & AWS tooling installed to manage AWS resources. Sounds fun, innit.

My tinkering has brought me so far where I can spin a Docker container with Ansible & AWS tooling and then can interact with AWS resources.

So I create a Dockerfile and then execute the `docker build --rm -t centos:ansible .` command to get an image.

```docker
FROM centos:centos7.7.1908

RUN yum check-update; \
    yum install -y gcc libffi-devel python-devel openssl-devel epel-release; \
    yum install -y python-pip python-wheel; \
    yum install -y openssh-server openssh-clients; \
    yum install -y sshpass; \
    yum install -y ansible; \
    yum install -y python-boto python-boto3; \
    yum install -y awscli
```

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it --name ansiblecontrol --env "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKAWSACCESSKEY6L" --env "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=NkTAwSsEcReTaCcEsSkEyznI" centos:ansible
[root@bbe66441e454 /]# 
[root@bbe66441e454 /]# aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "Account": "912345678908", 
    "UserId": "AKAWSACCESSKEY6L", 
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::912345678908:user/opstodevops"
}
[root@bbe66441e454 /]# aws s3 mb s3://demobucketforansible
make_bucket: demobucketforansible
[root@bbe66441e454 /]# aws s3 ls
2020-05-06 04:54:57 demobucketforansible
[root@bbe66441e454 /]# aws s3 rb s3://demobucketforansible                                                                                                                                                                                          
remove_bucket: demobucketforansible
[root@bbe66441e454 /]# exit
exit
```

What I liked about this setup is that when I exit out of it, my container is gone cause I started it with `--rm` switch. 
I don't have to worry about credentials and if I have to add/remove package then I can do that in my Dockerfile.

Now with the controlnode ready, it is time for playing with Ansible.

Untill next time!
